### vContact2
vConTACT2 is a tool to perform guilt-by-contig-association classification of viral genomic sequence data. It's designed to cluster and provide taxonomic context of viral metagenomic sequencing data.

<font color=red>But vContact2 is no more maintained, and many conflicts/errors of packages were raised. Running test samples failed. </font>

### CRISPRclassify
CRISPRclassify identifies loci from assembled genomic and metagenomic files (.fasta), and uses a cas-independent classification approach to predict the subtype of each locus. CRISPRclassify can be used via web-interface, or executed directly from the command line.

<font color=red>But CRISPRclassify can't run normally in R or in commandline.</font>
